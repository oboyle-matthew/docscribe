Stephanie
* quiet, confusion post-reading the survey
    * Enters into the text box that she’s unable to move
    * Enters in the slider pain without much of a thought
* submits
* For sever back pains, re-edits the text box to suggest sever back pains
* Enters it hurts so back in the dynamic boxes; seems like a smooth flow
* Wanted to submit a new version of the survey rather than modify the old one
    * Confused about where the previous ones go, or just the most recent ones

Lucic
* Reading the survey questions
    * Re-reading the prompt after looking at the app
    * Updates the pain sensor to a higher level after a bit of pause
* Back pain question
    * Enters in the comment box fairly immediately
        * “Severe back pains”
    * Seemed fairly straightforward to him (“no difficult”)
    * People seem to be getting hung up on the keyboard not disappearing after entering the question into the text box
* Physical therapy
    * Not quite sure where to go
    * Seems to be confused with it being on the second page; non-intuitive
    * Couldn’t complete the task
        * Couldn’t figure out where it is
* General comments
    * Doesn’t look like he completed the other two parts
* Missed the hydrocodone pills question; going back
    * Took a bit of pause between the type of pill and the quantity; dynamic update seemed mildly confusing

Aditya
* First question
    * drops the pain scale and enters into the text box simultaneously
* Fam zips straight through, not necessarily following questions strictly
* Adds severe back pain to the text box
    * Asks if there’s a word limit to the text box
* Man is confused here on what exactly the first question is asking, walking back his earlier response
* No problem with the pills one
* Dynamic one kind of throws people off a bit / gives them pause

1. Not moving well today doesn’t necessarily mean pain
2. Thought you had to move to the mobility page to get to this. Wasn’t clear. To do something simple, you have to do 8 more steps. 
3. Seemed fine with this question
4. Fairly easy to do
In the keyboard, have to click return to go to the submit button
More visually pleasing. Lots of different font sizes. Font size not big enough. Date big enough
Create a home page/end page

Conrad
1. Comments. Easy to do
2. Comments. Not intuitive to exit out of keyboard
3. Easy to do
4. This was fine
Different colors to break up the questions/break things up a little more

Not clear what comments are for
How severe is your pain. Goes from green to red. Don’t even put the numbers visible
Comments at the very end
Switch the pain control and then medication.

Testing/home page
Don’t know how to communicate you’re not moving well
Is this the home page????
1. Struggled a little to find this. Wasn’t sure if it would be in pain or mobility
2. Found the comment box, but not straight away
3. EZ
4. EZ
Main page. A bit more information about what the app is/where things are
No question mark at the end of the submit question
