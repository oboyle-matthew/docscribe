## Discussion Items

| Item | Who | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| RedCAP functionality | Marissa, Cory | RedCAP has a lot of built-in utilities, such as survey creation and notification by email or SMS. Then we just need to link them to the pre-built survey. Our app is effectively redundant, and less secure than the alternative.|
| Privacy of RedCAP | Marissa | RedCAP has the ability to create surveys and notifications within its system, which makes it secure. "Anything but a social security number can be added"|
| Why a mobile app? | Cory | A Web App is platform-agnostic and easier to interface with RedCAP. Plus if we want to make a mobile app afterwards we have the "blueprint" set up already. Both Cory and Marissa recommended this change.|
| MyCAP| Marissa | Turns out some people from Duke and Vanderbilt have made a native app that basically does what Dr. Olson wants on a professional level of design called MyCAP.|
| EPIC interfacing | Marissa | Literally no chance of it happening with our app. Has to have an entire usage plan setup by the Duke team. |
| RedCAP sandbox | Marissa, Nik | Nik now has a RedCAP account which can be used to play with the system.|


## Action Items

| Done? | Item | Responsible | Due Date |

| | Talk to Duvall about what to do now | Team | Oct. 5 |
| | Contact Dr. Olson to talk about the future of DocScribe | Team | Oct. 10 |


## Other Notes and Information

It really seems like we might do ourselves a favor by focusing on making a Web App instead of mobile. But we should also talk to Dr. Olson about what we're dealing with and whether there's a way for us to provide a unique utility not given by MyCAP. In general it feels like our app has been made obsolete before we even started, and I don't know if Duvall has a plan for this sort of situation.
